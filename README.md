**Spending 50kEuro - operational security procedures for anonymous hosting** â€” As of 2015, Delft University owns 50000Euro of Bitcoins to buy computer hardware in complete privacy. Your task is to spend these Bitcoins in a safe and productive manner by devising and documenting operational security procedures for anonymous hosting. If finished and approved you will be asked to help execute your own plans. You will investigate and search the literature on how to make Bitcoins anonymous and how to safely procure private servers for anonimized Bitcoins. You will search the literature on anonymous cash and hosting. Documentation also includes trial evidence used against the Silk Road in order to document basic mistakes.

## Anonymous payment
Bitcoin could be used to pay for hosting. Several (hosting) companies/providers accept Bitcoin payments. The point is, Bitcoin transactions are public and therefore not totally anonymous. Several techniques could be used to anonymize: mixing transactions, shared wallets. Some commercial services exist: Bitcoin Fog, BitLaundry, Blockchain.info's Send Shared. There's been many research on the anonymity of Bitcoin and we could probably use that.
